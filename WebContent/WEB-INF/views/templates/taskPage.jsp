  RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. &mdash; President Obama on Tuesday challenged Republicans to offer a plausible rationale for refusing to consider a Supreme Court candidate to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, and he pledged to nominate someone with an &ldquo;outstanding legal mind&rdquo; who cares about democracy and the rule of law. &ldquo;The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now,&rdquo; Mr. Obama said during a news conference after a meeting in California with leaders of Southeast Asia. He said the Constitution demanded that a president nominate someone for the court and the Senate either confirms or rejects. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off years,&rdquo; Mr. Obama said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not in the constitutional text.&rdquo;
