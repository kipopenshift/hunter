Step 3: Enter command CONNECT SYS as SYSDBA; 

This command helps you to connect to the SQL Server as Database Administrator.

Here SYSDBA is the ROLEName.

Oh wait, you are not yet connected… , SYS is the userName, now you have to enter the password to get connected

Step 4: Next Enter SYS_password
You will see the command “SQL>Connected”
Now you are the ADMINISTRATOR. So, you can control your SQL Server, which means you can control your DB Account even.

Step 5: Next Enter the following command

select username,password,account_status from dba_users;

This command retrieves the UserName , Password and Account status of all the accounts in your SQL Server.
You will also find your Oracle DB name that is “LOCKED” and the LOCK that is TIMED.
