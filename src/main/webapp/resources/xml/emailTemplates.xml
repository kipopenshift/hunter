					<p>
Fellow Kenyans, Today , work begins.<br>
The time has come, not to ask what community we come from but rather  what dreams we share. The time has come not to ask what political party  we belong to but rather what partnerships we can build. The time has  come to<br>
ask , not who we voted for, but what future we are devoted to.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
									
									<p>Fellow Kenyans we must move forward together. Let us remember  that although we may not be bound together by ethnicity, or cultural  practices or religious conviction – our kinship rests solidly upon the  fact that we have all been adopted by Kenya’s borders; we are all  children of this nation, we are all bound to one constitution which  calls us to rise above our individual ideologies and march to our  national anthem.&nbsp;</p>
									<p>That anthem reminds us of the fundamental  principles upon which our prosperity must be built. It calls us to  reflect on the power of peace; to recall the supreme value of freedom;  to believe, once more, in the beauty of service<br>
and brotherhood; to aspire each day, to the dignity that results from  hard work, and to contend for the hope that justice brings.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters; Fellow Kenyans – let us move forward,  together, in the spirit of our anthem and in the spirit of our  constitution being confident that if we turn neither to the left nor to  the right of our national values, we, as a people, will see the promised  land of prosperity that our forbearers set out for.<br>
<br>
God bless you, God bless the Republic of Kenya and God bless Africa.</p>

H.E. HON. UHURU KENYATTA, C.G.H.,<br/>
PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE FORCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
